# Mercado Libre Frontend test
Test for frontend interview at Mercado Libre

## Getting started
First thing to know is that this repository has two branches. 

- master: includes a middleware (or a BFF) that can be accessed directly using Postman (or other similar app)
- angular-version: is a branch based off of master and is up-to-date. Besides, it includes a frontend on Angular 7 to access to those APIs

## Installation
Doesn't matter the branch you are in, these three steps are the only ones needed
1- git checkout <some-branch>
2- npm i
3- npm run serve
